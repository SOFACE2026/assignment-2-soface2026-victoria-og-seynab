// Implement the code of ShopAbs in C emulating the polymorphism 
// provided by means of the abstract class Shop. 
// In this implementation function pointers are required. 
// They need to be implemented as members of the struct Shop. 
// The implementation of ShoeShop must declare the function
// pointers in exactly the same order. 
// A type cast to ’(Shop*)’ needs to be used to use a ShoeShop via a Shop pointer.
